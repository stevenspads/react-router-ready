# React Router Ready

This repository contains the app that is built as part of the book [React Router Ready: Learn React Router with React and TypeScript](https://lumin8media.com/books/react-router-ready-learn-react-router-with-react-and-typescript). Learn React Router fundamentals by building and managing a realistic store app with an inventory of products. Go from React Router rookie to React Router ready!
